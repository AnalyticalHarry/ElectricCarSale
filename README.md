# Electric car Sale

ðŸš€ Hey Quant and ML enthusiasts! I've just accomplished a remarkable feat - designing Machine Learning algorithms for Train, Test, and Split using Object-Oriented Programming. ðŸ˜Ž
I've also conducted a sales analysis and trend analysis using Linear Regression, and the results are fantastic! ðŸ“ˆ The model I designed works perfectly and in this report, I've taken a closer look at the top 10 selling car companies in the United States.

I've analyzed three companies that are publicly traded in the US stock market. Although I can't validate the actual performance of these companies until I have access to their financial statements and current cash flow, my results show a downward trend, possibly due to the ongoing recession.

Don't miss out on this exciting opportunity to delve deeper into the world of Machine Learning and trend analysis. Check out the full report now! ðŸ”Ž
